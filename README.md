# Project Title & Description

**Podcaster SPA** is a single-page web application that displays an audio playlist obtained from the Apple iTunes API, with a search function and detailed views where each post or song can be played.

## üõ† Tech stack

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) as Front-end TypeScript framework based on [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/).

### üî¶ Prerequisites

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) >= `9.+` *Recommended* `9.5.0`
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= `18+` *Recommended* `18.15.0`

### ‚öô Installation & run locally

```bash
# clone repo from GitHub with:
# ...HTTPS...
$ git clone https://github.com/jalofernandez/podcaster-spa.git

# ...SSH...
$ git clone git@github.com:jalofernandez/podcaster-spa.git

# ...or GitHub CLI
$ gh repo clone jalofernandez/podcaster-spa

# enter to project folder
$ cd podcaster-spa

# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### ‚úÖ Running Quality code checks

#### Run Lint

```bash
  npm run lint
```
